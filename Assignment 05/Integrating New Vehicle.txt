I cannot attach Spaceship.class and SwiftDzire.class as I couldn't compile them.
According to me, the error that I am geting is due to the fact that both of 
those Vehicle classes failed to have a super() in their constructor and instead
called a self defined method to call the parent constructor/ method to add 
common vehicle attributes. 

Therefore, in my code, I have commented out the part that adds those two Vehicle
classes.
